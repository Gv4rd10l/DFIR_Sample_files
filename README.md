# DFIR Practice Resources

This repository provides a collection of files you can use to exercise your Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR) skills.

## Contents

You will find:

- Windows Registry files  
- Log files  
- Volatile memory captures  

For **PCAP file analysis**, I recommend exploring the following external resources:

- [Malware Traffic Analysis](https://www.malware-traffic-analysis.net/index.html)  
- [StopDDoS Packet Captures Repository](https://github.com/StopDDoS/packet-captures)

These websites offer a wide range of PCAP samples and traffic analysis exercises to strengthen your network forensic capabilities.

Happy hunting!
